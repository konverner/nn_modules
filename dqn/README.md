## Deep Q-learning

Deep Q-learning is application of neural network in Q-learning algorithm. This application allows
to generalize the algorithm, namely, it allows to work on infinite state space. This repository contanins
Python implementation of DQN with an example of simplified snake game. 


Detailed explanation of theory and code is available on [Medium](https://medium.com/@konst.verner/simple-and-deep-q-learning-learning-theory-implementation-in-python-part-ii-133712054e69)

## Get Started

**Train**

* adjust configuration in config.py

* run train.py script in a line command

```
python train.py
```

**Test**

* provide paths to model weights in (*.pt) and adjust other configurations if needed in `config.py` file

* run test.py script in a line command

```
python test.py
```
