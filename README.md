## Neural Networks Modules

In this repository I store my implements of neural networks modules from scratch such as convolution, correlation, attention and others. It serves me and other people educational purpose. Each module is provided with tests, short and extended discriptions.

**Modules implemented:**

* `cnn`: 1d convolution, 1d correlation

* `dqn`: deep q-learning neural network, memory replay

* `gpt`: multihead attention mechanism, decoder layer from transformer, gpt
